## Introduction

Hi. I'm the webmaster for UF WiCSE. As a computer science club, UF WiCSE needs a great website, which is what I'm striving for here. Throughout this year, I'll be updating this repo and the website accordingly. My ultimate goal is to continue to improve this website with each commit. If you have any suggestions, please let me know :)

## Special Thanks

I want to thank each and every one of the E-Board members of UF WiCSE, who provided invaluable insight and suggestions when I was designing this website. Additionally, I'm very grateful to all the great coders who have made such awesome plugins, including PhotoSwipe, Animate.css, and WOW.js.
